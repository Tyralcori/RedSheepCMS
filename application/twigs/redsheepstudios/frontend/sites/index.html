We are pretty to announce the official takeover of elitecoder.eu!
Elitecoder represents a great team, which have excellent know how by developing software solutions.
In the year 2010 until 2013 i was the "CTO", so i know, how they work. After a long meeting, we decided to cooprate to learn from each other and make RedSheeps to a fast growing studio.
The next days we have to restructure some parts. At least i have to say, that everything is still an hobby project, and we don't wanna earn money with our "daily doing" for RedSheeps.

So far ~ Alex</pre>

Redsheep Studios needs you! Currently i am the only developer in the project. The software grows very well, no question. But it would be great, if some people can help me in some parts.
